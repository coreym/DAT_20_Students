+## About Me
+
+- My name is John Hogan.
+- I'm currently working as a Consultant at BAV Consulting. We are a small consultancy owned by an Ad Agency (Young and Rubicam). We leverage the largest Historical Syndicated Study of Brand Equity for a lot our work. Lots of data, but data currently heavily under-utilized.
+- I work with a ton of survey data and some aggregated KPI data from clients. Its great because its tidy, but there are its inherent limits in terms of actionable, real-time applicability. I would like to learn to collect, clean, combine and leverage the vast amount of information out there in an effcient and actionable way.
+- My objective is to learn about different data sources and data types to hopefully figure out ways to apply it to broader brand strategy consulting. There is a massive void in the market place for stable and effective brand tracking. Ideally id like to elevate my knowledge of programmatic and statistical methods and maybe start something with a colleague soon that is like what i do in my current role but hopefully way cooler.
