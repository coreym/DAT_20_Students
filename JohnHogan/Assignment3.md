+- Anomoly detection.
+- A type of classification model. Assumes data frame / data sample being analyzed represents a single class. Model attempts to identify obsevations that are atypical, given the characteristics of the data.
+- In simplest terms, it identifies outliers based on low probability outcomes in a given sample of data. 
+- In real life, outliers are potentially valuable. The most widely used example is fraud detection, where algorthms built on massive amounts of transactional data to understand typical purchase behaviour, in order to target fraudulent activity.
+- In my day-to-day, while not as sexy as other uses, anomaly detection can be used to identify shitty respondents in survey data.
+- If you had a lot of time-series data, a company could use anomaly detection to look at irregularities in traffic compared to regular seasonality fluctuations. This could help the company learn from historical data to do more effective promotional strategies down the line.
