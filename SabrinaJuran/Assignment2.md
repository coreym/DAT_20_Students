## Name and Title
Sabrina Juran, Technical Soecialist for Data and Population Research

## Current Work and Data Experience
I have been working at the UN for 7 years supporting National Statistical
Offices in their population and housing censuses. I work with large data sets, such as census microdata or survey data. Because the UN is looking for alternative data sources to inform its policy formulation and programming, I want to learn more about the skills and dimensions of data sciece. 

## Why DAT_20
The UN is more and more looking into non-tarditional data to inform ther policy formulation and programming. In order for me to advice on what potential data could be useful for what purpose, I enrolled in DAT_20
