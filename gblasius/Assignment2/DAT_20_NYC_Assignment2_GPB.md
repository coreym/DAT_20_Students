# **Assignment #2**

#### My name is Glenn Blasius.   I am a 52 year finance professional. I’ve worked at a number of investment banks and investment companies, specializing in Asset Backed Securities.   I have worked in New York, Australia, and the United Kingdom during my career.   

I am currently in an interesting position.  Having worked on Wall St and in the “Square Mile” of London for a long time, I am now taking time to reinvent myself and to spend time looking into new business opportunities particularly in the area of big data.   I am a firm believer in the power of information and free markets, and would like to explore opportunities which occurs at the intersection of information and economics.     

I have worked with data during my entire career - initially as an analyst, then as a trader of mortgage backed securities, then as a portfolio manager sifting through portfolio data provided by banks.    The work I’ve done on data is simplistic relative to the world of data scientists, but it is interesting.   In many cases, it was important to be able to arrive at investment conclusions from sparse or dirty datasets.   “Cleaning” data “tapes” was an important job for many an aspiring structured credit trader on Wall St.   Having spent countless hours doing this and sorting through dirty data, it is liberating to think that soon tools will be able to eliminate this drudgery - as well as provide new insights!  

I want to be challenged, to learn more about data science, to meet interesting people, and to hear about new ideas for changing the world!

Here’s a recent article applying big data analysis to genetics - fascinating!
