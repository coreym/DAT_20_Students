# K-Means Clustering

### Summary
K-means is a type of clustering algorithm that takes a set of data and evaluates the relationships between different observations or entries. As such, it's a helpful technique for exploring data. It helps us determine the ways in which observations, entries, or individuals are alike (or dissimilar). Observations are grouped by determining a set of centroids--the most typical/representative cases in each cluster--and then measuring the distance between a given centroid and a given observation. 

There are a variety of distance measures from which to choose, and the most appropriate measures will vary based on the characteristics of the underlying data and the types of questions one is interested in answering. For example, in binary data, a value associated with an action may be more important than a value associated with an instance of inaction (or, indeed, vice versa). We may wish to weigh the decision to make a purchase more heavily than a decision not to make a purchase in order to get a better view of the factors that characterize customers. 

### Examples
1) *Segmenting e-commerce customers.* Using k-means clustering, we could potentially identify different customer segments, such as bargain-hunters, high-rollers, last-minute shoppers, etc.

2) *Understanding demographic features associated with behavioral research data.* Given respondents' participation in, say, a psychology study measuring mean response times, we could test a large number of participants and subsequently identify the characteristics exogenous to the study that help explain their performance.
