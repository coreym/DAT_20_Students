Hi there! My name is **Jeneuse Geula** and I'm a Data Analyst at [CB Insights](http://cbinsights.com/). 

I've worked with several types of data in my current job including: 

1. Investor & Company level data (who is investing in what companies; what companies are raising the most money, etc)
2. Industry & Geography data
3. User behavior data
4. Internal reporting 


I signed up for this course as I'm currently using SQL & excel and would like to both learn to manipulate data in python, as well as learn better analysis techniques. 

Here's a data-driven [tweet](https://twitter.com/TheFix/status/578730486350114817) I found ~~amusing~~ sad.
