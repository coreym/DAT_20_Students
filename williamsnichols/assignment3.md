# Oracle data mining algorithms

## Decision tree

### Usage: what data problems does this algorithm solve?

- This solves the data problem of identifying similar characteristics from past instances in a dataset to predict the likelihood of future outcomes.

### What does this algorithm do?

- The decision tree algorithm is used to predict the likelihood of a certain outcome from a (usually) defined list of possible outcomes.

- In some cases, the outcome is binary, i.e. a customer will or will not place an order.

### Two business applications

1. In my line of work, the decision tree algorithm can be used to predict the likelihood that a first-time customer will place a second, third, fourth, etc order based on the characteristics of the previous order, particularly lateness.

2. In marketing, you might predict the likelihood of a certain customer segment -- based on age, device/browser, location etc -- to make a purchase. This might inform if and how you target this segment with ads.
