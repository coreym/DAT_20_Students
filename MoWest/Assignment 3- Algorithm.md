## Algorithm

- I read about Decision Tree.
- This algorithm solves problems relating to classification.
- Decision Trees use conditional probability in order to predict an outcome.
- This algorithm can be used to see how high end hockey sticks or skates can affect the play of hockey players at different skill levels.  It can also be used to gauge how likely consumers are to purchase an entire album after one single from the album is given away on itunes for free.  Lastly, Decision Trees can be used to predict how likely a user is to leave a Yelp review after a restaurant sends them an email asking them to leave one.
