## Short Bio

- My name is Jonathan Westrich, no one really calls me Jonathan though.  Just Mo or Moshe.
- I'm currently working as an actuary.
- I'm interested in working with sports data, I know there's a lot of that out there.  I'm also interested in music industry data.
- At work I deal with fairly large data sets, but exclusively insurance related data.  I'm looking to learn skills that will allow me to analyze and make projections from any kind of data.  Particularly, data that's more interesting to me than insurance.
- A simple site with a lot of obscure NHL statistics is http://stats.hockeyanalysis.com/index.php.
