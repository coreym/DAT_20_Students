The algorithm I read about was the One-Class Support Vector Machine. It is used
to to find cases that are anomalies based on their deviation from the rest of
the data set. From what I understand the algorithm trains your model of what is
a normal occurance, so when un anomaly is added it can be flagged immediatly. .
It could also be good to show outliers that exist in data sets that can be
looked at further. It seems to have a large application in finding fraud. This
could be seen in insurance companies trying to find fraudalent claims.
