ii. Recently I completed my Bachelors degree in economics and am looking for a
job

iii. I have a big interest in sports data, and do some research in that area.
Ive also worked with census data and bureau of labor statistics along with other
government data for various internships and school assignments

iv. I signed up for this class because Im always doing research with different
data, but there is only so much you can do with excel. Id like to learn skills
to be able to build predictive models from large datasets and hopefully find
employment in the future in the data science field
