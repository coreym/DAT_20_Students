# Assignment 2
_short introduction about me_

- My name is __Anna Kochetkova__ :girl:

- I am a _statistician_ :bar_chart: in between jobs
- Most recently I worked with historical simulations for financial instruments. 
Prior to that I applied linear and logistic regressions to biostatistical data. 
It would be very interesting for me to play with data from other fields.
- My reasons to sign up for this course:
  - using __python__ for data analysis
  - practicing with data outside of my realm of experience
  - review of machine learning algorithms, like SVM
  - learning new tools: _GitHub_ being one of them :smile:
- Good source of financial data:

They also have a python library that pulls tickers into a pandas object.
